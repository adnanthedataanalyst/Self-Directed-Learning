# **Exploring Moderators of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning Effect on Self-Directed Learning**

## **Gap:**
Despite numerous meta-analyses on mobile-assisted language learning (MALL), no meta-analysis study has synthesized research on the impact of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) on Self-Directed Learning (SDL) by analyzing its effects across different comparison conditions:
- Comparison conditions:
  - MALL vs computer-based learning (CBL)
  - MALL vs MALL minus experimental feature (MMF)
  - MALL vs paper-based learning (PBL)
- Or identified condition-specific moderators.

## **Objectives:**
- This study, grounded in self-determination theory, delves into the impact of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) on Self-Directed Learning (SDL) by analyzing its effects across different comparison conditions:
  - MALL vs CBL
  - MALL vs MMF
  - MALL vs PBL
- Additionally, the study seeks to identify moderators specific to each condition.

## **Research Questions:**
- **RQ1:** What is the effect of MALL on SDL as contrasted to three comparison conditions (MALL vs CBL, MALL vs MMF, and MALL vs PBL)?
- **RQ2:** What variables moderate MALL impacts on SDL in each comparison condition?

## **Theoretical Framework:**
Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and Tsai's framework serve as the theoretical underpinning.
- **SDT** emphasizes autonomy, competence, and relatedness in driving motivation and learning outcomes.
- **Tsai's framework** categorizes studies based on comparison conditions, guiding the analysis of MALL's impact on SDL.

## **Method:**
- The meta-analysis integrates data from selected studies through pre-defined selection criteria.
- Hedge's g is employed as the effect size metric, utilizing a random-effects model to address heterogeneity.
- Moderation analysis is conducted using subgroup and meta-regression analyses.

## **Results:**
- This meta-analysis synthesized data from 7 studies comparing MALL vs MMF and 26 studies comparing MALL vs PBL, all published between 2009 and 2021.
- These studies collectively involved 1,964 participants and aimed to assess MALL's effect on SDL under varying comparison conditions.

- **The MALL vs CBL comparison condition was excluded from the analysis because** it did not meet the minimum requirement of two studies (Valentine et al., 2010; Goh et al., 2016) to calculate an aggregate effect size.
- Findings are organized by research questions.

### **RQ1:** 
- **MALL vs. MMF (Technology-Based with a Feature vs. Technology-Based without a Feature):**
  - MALL typically has a small impact on enhancing SDL compared to MMF technology-based methods without a particular feature.
- **MALL vs. PBL (Technology-Based vs. Non-Technology-Based):**
  - MALL generally has a bigger impact on improving SDL compared to PBL (Paper-Based Learning)

Note. *p < .05, NR= not reported, K = number of studies, CI = confidence interval, df = degree of freedom., g= Hedges’ g, Fail-safe N > 5 Nes + 10

### **RQ2:**
- **Subgroup analysis**
- **Significant moderators across all conditions:**
  - Application type, assessment type, language proficiency, mother tongue, target language, and target language skills significantly impact MALL effectiveness on SDL as contrasted to both MMF and PBL comparison conditions.

## **Moderators Varying Based on Conditions:**
- The analysis shows that in MALL vs MMF comparison condition, feedback, intervention duration, and learning context **did not significantly** impact MALL's effect on SDL.
- However, in MALL vs PBL comparison condition, all three factors had a significant influence.

## **Univariate Meta-Regression Analysis**
- In this study, the univariate meta-regression analysis showed no single independent variable that could explain the variability in the MMF condition. However, in the PBL condition, device type and target language accounted for 23% and 12% of the variability, respectively, in the univariate analysis.

## **Multivariate Meta-Regression Analysis**
- Due to the high heterogeneity (86%) in PBL studies, a multivariate meta-regression analysis was conducted. The best model, which included application type, assessment type, device type, language proficiency, learning context, and mother tongue, accounted for 92% of the variability.

# Publication bias

Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Rosenthal's fail-safe N test.
