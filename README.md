# Self-Directed-Learning

**Study Summary: Exploring Moderators of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning Effect on Self-Directed Learning**

**Abstract:**

**Gap:**
Despite previous research on mobile-assisted language learning (MALL), there's a gap in understanding how self-directed learning (SDL) varies across comparison conditions and the moderators influencing this relationship.

**Research Objectives:**
This meta-analysis aims to investigate SDL effects in MALL, grounded in self-determination theory, and identify condition-specific moderators. Research objectives focus on examining SDL's effect in comparison to computer-based learning (CBL), MALL minus experimental feature (MMF), and paper-based learning (PBL), along with identifying moderators influencing these effects.

**Methodology:**
Methodologically, the meta-analysis integrates data from selected studies using pre-defined criteria, employing Hedge's g as the effect size metric and a random-effects model to address heterogeneity. Moderation analysis involves subgroup and meta-regression analyses.

**Results:**
Findings indicate significant differences in SDL effectiveness between MALL and MMF, as well as MALL and PBL conditions. Various moderators including application type, assessment type, language proficiency, and target language significantly influence MALL's impact on SDL. Publication bias assessment suggests robustness in findings. 

This study fills a crucial gap in understanding SDL effects in MALL across different comparison conditions, offering insights for stakeholders in educational technology and language learning and identifying areas for future research, particularly in exploring feedback effects in MALL and comparisons with computer-based learning.

# Objectives

**Objectives:**
The study aims to investigate SDL in MALL, grounded in self-determination theory, by analyzing its effects across different comparison conditions and identifying condition-specific moderators. Research questions focus on SDL's effect in comparison to computer-based learning (CBL), MALL minus experimental feature (MMF), and paper-based learning (PBL), as well as moderators influencing these effects.

**Theoretical Framework:**
Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and Tsai's framework serve as the theoretical underpinning. SDT emphasizes autonomy, competence, and relatedness in driving motivation and learning outcomes. Tsai's framework categorizes studies based on comparison conditions, guiding the analysis of MALL's impact on SDL.

**Method:**
The meta-analysis integrates data from 27 selected studies through pre-defined selection criteria. Hedge's g is employed as the effect size metric, utilizing a random-effects model to address heterogeneity. Moderation analysis is conducted using subgroup and meta-regression analyses.

**Results:**
Findings indicate significant differences in SDL effectiveness between MALL and MMF, as well as MALL and PBL conditions. Various moderators including application type, assessment type, language proficiency, and target language significantly influence MALL's impact on SDL. Publication bias assessment suggests robustness in findings.

# Study Significance

**Study Significance:**
This study fills a gap in understanding SDL effects in MALL across different comparison conditions. It offers insights for app developers, educators, and researchers, emphasizing the importance of factors like assessment and feedback in enhancing SDL. The study also identifies areas for future research, urging more investigation into feedback effects in MALL and comparisons with computer-based learning.

In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides valuable insights into the relationship between MALL, SDL, and comparison conditions, offering directions for further research and practical implications for stakeholders in educational technology and language learning.
