# Exploring Moderators of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning Effect on Self-Directed Learning


# Gap:
Despite numerous meta-analyses on mobile-assisted language learning (MALL), no meta-analysis study has synthesized research on the impact of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) on Self-Directed Learning (SDL) by analyzing its effects across different comparison conditions:
- Comparison conditions:
  - MALL vs computer-based learning (CBL)
  - MALL vs MALL minus experimental feature (MMF)
  - MALL vs paper-based learning (PBL)
- Or identified condition-specific moderators.
 
# Objectives

- This study, grounded in self-determination theory, delves into the impact of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) on Self-Directed Learning (SDL) by analyzing its effects across different comparison conditions:
  - MALL vs CBL
  - MALL vs MMF
  - MALL vs PBL
- Additionally, the study seeks to identify moderators specific to each condition.

# Research Questions
 
- **RQ1:** What is the effect of MALL on SDL as contrasted to three comparison conditions ( MALL vs CBL, 
MALLvs MMF, and MALL vs PBL)?

- **RQ2:** What variables moderate MALL impacts on SDL in each comparison condition?

 
# Theoretical Framework:
Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and Tsai's framework serve as the theoretical underpinning. 

**SDT** emphasizes autonomy, competence, and relatedness in driving motivation and learning outcomes. 

**Tsai's framework** categorizes studies based on comparison conditions, guiding the analysis of MALL's impact on SDL.

# Method:
- The meta-analysis integrates data from selected studies  through pre-defined selection criteria.
- Hedge's g is employed as the effect size metric, utilizing a random-effects model to address heterogeneity.
- Moderation analysis is conducted using subgroup and meta-regression analyses.

# Results:

- This meta-analysis synthesized data from 7 studies comparing MALL vs MMF and 26 studies comparing MALL vs PBL, all published between 2009 and 2021.
- These studies collectively involved 1,964 participants and aimed to assess MALL's effect on SDL under varying comparison conditions.
- **The MALL vs CBL comparison condition was excluded from the analysis because** it did not meet the minimum requirement of two studies (Valentine et al., 2010; Goh et al., 2016) to calculate an aggregate effect size.
- Findings are organized by research questions.

- **RQ1:** What is the effect of MALL on SDL as contrasted to three comparison conditions (
MALLvs MMF, and MALL vs PBL)?
