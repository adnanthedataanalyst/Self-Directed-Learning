# Exploring Moderators of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning Effect on Self-Directed Learning


# Gap:
Despite numerous meta-analyses on mobile-assisted language learning (MALL), no meta-analysis study has synthesized research on the impact of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) on Self-Directed Learning (SDL) by analyzing its effects across different comparison conditions:
- Comparison conditions:
  - MALL vs computer-based learning (CBL)
  - MALL vs MALL minus experimental feature (MMF)
  - MALL vs paper-based learning (PBL)
- Or identified condition-specific moderators.
 
# Objectives

- This study, grounded in self-determination theory, delves into the impact of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) on Self-Directed Learning (SDL) by analyzing its effects across different comparison conditions:
  - MALL vs CBL
  - MALL vs MMF
  - MALL vs PBL
- Additionally, the study seeks to identify moderators specific to each condition.

# Research Questions
 
- **RQ1:** What is the effect of MALL on SDL as contrasted to three comparison conditions ( MALL vs CBL, 
MALLvs MMF, and MALL vs PBL)?

- **RQ2:** What variables moderate MALL impacts on SDL in each comparison condition?

 
# Theoretical Framework:
Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and Tsai's framework serve as the theoretical underpinning. 

**SDT** emphasizes autonomy, competence, and relatedness in driving motivation and learning outcomes. 

**Tsai's framework** categorizes studies based on comparison conditions, guiding the analysis of MALL's impact on SDL.

**Method:**
The meta-analysis integrates data from 27 selected studies through pre-defined selection criteria. 
Hedge's g is employed as the effect size metric, utilizing a random-effects model to address heterogeneity. 
Moderation analysis is conducted using subgroup and meta-regression analyses.

**Results:**
Findings indicate significant differences in SDL effectiveness between MALL and MMF, as well as MALL and PBL conditions. Various moderators including application type, assessment type, language proficiency, and target language significantly influence MALL's impact on SDL. Publication bias assessment suggests robustness in findings.
