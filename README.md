# Self-Directed-Learning

**Study Summary: Exploring Moderators of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning Effect on Self-Directed Learning**

 
# Objectives

- This study, grounded in self-determination theory, delves into the impact of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) on Self-Directed Learning (SDL) by analyzing its effects across different comparison conditions:
  - MALL vs computer-based learning (CBL)
  - MALL vs MALL minus experimental feature (MMF)
  - MALL vs paper-based learning (PBL)
- It also aims to identify condition-specific moderators.

 
 Research questions focus comparing the effect of MALL on SDL in comparison to computer-based learning (CBL), MALL minus experimental feature (MMF), and paper-based learning (PBL), as well as moderators influencing these effects.
 
**RQ1:** What is the effect of MALL on SDL as contrasted to three comparison conditions ( MALL vs CBL, 
MALLvs MMF, and MALL vs PBL)?

 
# Theoretical Framework:
Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and Tsai's framework serve as the theoretical underpinning. 

**SDT** emphasizes autonomy, competence, and relatedness in driving motivation and learning outcomes. 

**Tsai's framework** categorizes studies based on comparison conditions, guiding the analysis of MALL's impact on SDL.

**Method:**
The meta-analysis integrates data from 27 selected studies through pre-defined selection criteria. 
Hedge's g is employed as the effect size metric, utilizing a random-effects model to address heterogeneity. 
Moderation analysis is conducted using subgroup and meta-regression analyses.

**Results:**
Findings indicate significant differences in SDL effectiveness between MALL and MMF, as well as MALL and PBL conditions. Various moderators including application type, assessment type, language proficiency, and target language significantly influence MALL's impact on SDL. Publication bias assessment suggests robustness in findings.

# Study Significance

**Study Significance:**
This study fills a gap in understanding SDL effects in MALL across different comparison conditions. It offers insights for app developers, educators, and researchers, emphasizing the importance of factors like assessment and feedback in enhancing SDL. The study also identifies areas for future research, urging more investigation into feedback effects in MALL and comparisons with computer-based learning.

In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides valuable insights into the relationship between MALL, SDL, and comparison conditions, offering directions for further research and practical implications for stakeholders in educational technology and language learning.
