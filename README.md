# **Exploring Moderators of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning Effect on Self-Directed Learning**

## **Gap:**
Despite numerous meta-analyses on mobile-assisted language learning (MALL), no meta-analysis study has synthesized research on the impact of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) on Self-Directed Learning (SDL) by analyzing its effects across different comparison conditions:

**1. Technology-based learning vs technology-based learning**
  
| Comparison Condition                               | Experimental Group                                             | Comparison Group                                      |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| MALL vs computer-based learning (CBL)   | Students learn through a mobile device                        | Students learn through desktop computers              |
| MALL vs MALL minus feature (MMF) | Students learn through a mobile device with additional feature (e.g., with feedback) | Students learn through a mobile device with no additional feature (e.g., with feedback)  |
 
 **2. Technology-based learning vs non-technology-based learning**
 
| Comparison Condition                      | Experimental Group                        | Comparison Group                         |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| MALL vs paper-based learning (PBL)   | Students learn through a mobile device     | Students learn through PBL               |


- Or identified condition-specific moderators.

## **Objectives:**
- This study, grounded in self-determination theory, delves into the impact of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) on Self-Directed Learning (SDL) by analyzing its effects across different comparison conditions:
  - MALL vs CBL
  - MALL vs MMF
  - MALL vs PBL
- Additionally, the study seeks to identify moderators specific to each condition.

## **Research Questions:**
- **RQ1:** What is the effect of MALL on SDL as contrasted to three comparison conditions (MALL vs CBL, MALL vs MMF, and MALL vs PBL)?
- **RQ2:** What variables moderate MALL impacts on SDL in each comparison condition?

## **Theoretical Framework:**
Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and Tsai's framework serve as the theoretical underpinning.
- **SDT** emphasizes autonomy, competence, and relatedness in driving motivation and learning outcomes.
- **Tsai's framework** categorizes studies based on comparison conditions, guiding the analysis of MALL's impact on SDL.

## **Method:**
- The meta-analysis integrates data from selected studies through pre-defined selection criteria.
- Hedge's g is employed as the effect size metric, utilizing a random-effects model to address heterogeneity.
- Moderation analysis is conducted using subgroup and meta-regression analyses.

## **Results:**
- Figure 1 shows that this meta-analysis synthesized data from 27 studies: 7 studies with 459 participants comparing MALL vs MMF and 26 studies with 1,505 participants comparing MALL vs PBL, all published between 2009 and 2021.

# Publication bias

Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Rosenthal's fail-safe N test. Potential publication bias was noted, but it was deemed insignificant based on Rosenthal’s fail-safe N test.

### **RQ1:** What is the effect of MALL on SDL as contrasted to three comparison conditions (MALL vs CBL, MALL vs MMF, and MALL vs PBL)?

- **The MALL vs CBL comparison condition was excluded from the analysis because** it did not meet the minimum requirement of two studies (Valentine et al., 2010; Goh et al., 2016) to calculate an aggregate effect size.
- **MALL vs. MMF (Technology-Based with a Feature vs. Technology-Based without a Feature):**
  - MALL typically has a small impact on enhancing SDL compared to MMF technology-based methods without a particular feature.
- **MALL vs. PBL (Technology-Based vs. Non-Technology-Based):**
  - MALL generally has a bigger impact on improving SDL compared to PBL (Paper-Based Learning)

### **RQ2:** What variables moderate MALL impacts on SDL in each comparison condition?

- **Subgroup analysis**
  
- **Significant moderators across all conditions:**
  - Application type, assessment type, language proficiency, mother tongue, target language, and target language skills significantly impact MALL effectiveness on SDL as contrasted to both MMF and PBL comparison conditions.

## **Moderators Varying Based on Conditions:**
- The analysis shows that in MALL vs MMF comparison condition, feedback, intervention duration, and learning context **did not significantly** impact MALL's effect on SDL.
- However, in MALL vs PBL comparison condition, all three factors had a significant influence.

Note. 0= A value of "0" in the table indicates that there were no available studies or data for a particular subcategory within a specific variable, under certain conditions, NR= not reported, K = number of studies, CI = confidence interval, df = degree of freedom, g= Hedges’ g.


## **Univariate Meta-Regression Analysis**
- In this study, the univariate meta-regression analysis showed no single independent variable that could explain the variability in the MALL vs MMF condition. However, in the MALL vs PBLcondition, device type and target language accounted for 23% and 12% of the variability, respectively, in the univariate analysis.

# Insights and Applications for Practitioners, Researchers, Teachers, App Developers, and Decision Makers

**Practitioners:**
- Finding: The study revealed significant differences between MALL and paper-based learning (PBL), with MALL showing a medium-to-large effect (g = .88) on self-directed learning (SDL).
- Translation: Practitioners can prioritize the integration of MALL tools and platforms into their teaching practices, as these technologies have been shown to significantly enhance students' self-directed learning outcomes compared to traditional paper-based methods.

**Researchers:**

- Finding: Variables such as application type, assessment type, language proficiency, and target language skills significantly influenced MALL effectiveness on SDL in both MALL minus feature (MMF) and PBL conditions.
- Translation: Researchers can conduct further investigations to explore the specific mechanisms through which these variables impact self-directed learning outcomes in MALL environments.
- This could involve experimental studies or qualitative research to gain deeper insights into the interaction between these variables and SDL.

**Teachers:**
- Finding: Feedback mechanisms significantly influenced MALL's effect on SDL in comparison to PBL but not MMF.
- Translation: Teachers can prioritize the implementation of effective feedback mechanisms in MALL activities to support students' autonomy and competence in language acquisition.
- This could involve providing timely and personalized feedback to students based on their performance and progress in MALL tasks.

**App Developers:**
- Finding: Customizable feedback options and adaptive assessment mechanisms were identified as features that significantly support self-directed learning in MALL environments.
- Translation: App developers can focus on integrating customizable feedback options and adaptive assessment mechanisms into their MALL applications.
- This could involve designing feedback systems that allow users to personalize their feedback preferences and incorporating adaptive assessment algorithms that adjust the difficulty level of tasks based on individual learner performance.

**Decision Makers:**
- Finding: Heterogeneity was observed among comparison conditions, indicating variability in study results.
- Translation: Decision makers can use this information to understand the diverse outcomes associated with different MALL approaches and make informed decisions regarding the adoption of MALL programs in educational institutions.
- They can prioritize resources and support initiatives that align with best practices in MALL and promote the effective integration of technology into language learning curricula.
